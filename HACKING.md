# Hacking

## Code Organization

- **Libraries**:
    1. install via `bower` with `--save` flag.
    2. Add to the copy:libs task in Gruntfile.

- **Assets** : Images, Everything that needs to be copied into *build*.
- **Extra**  : Asseta for multiple-build version deployment
- **BOWER**  : Bower libs & components
- **Source** : JS code, templates, etc. Also copied after each modification into *build*.
- **builds** : build directories, each containing an extension with variations.
- **buiid**  : contains the current build.

## Conventions
- Services:
    - No callbacks project. Only promises. Anything that can fail should use promises, never fail silently or use a callback.
    - All promises go into variables, even if not used -> they will be.
    - Any async service should have local initting defer and should return the initting promise

## App Structure - Modularized File Organization
    - jade : app-level jade files
        - jade/templates : sub-templates for different angular components
    - js : app-level js files
        - js/common : common utilities, services, directives
        - js/launcher : main launcher business-logic, controllers, directives, everything related to apps
        - js/search : search box logic including auto complete
        - js/settings : setup, config, settings logics, including appearance, customization of the UI and remote update
        - js/vendor : modified 3rd party libs
    - less : less files to be compiled to css
    - less/import : less files to be included in the compiled less files.
